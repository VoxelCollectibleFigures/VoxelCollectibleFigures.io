# VoxelCollectibleFigures

Voxel collectible figures (VCFs) are digital collectible figures based on the voxel art. We start this NFT-Project with the thought of doing something good without attracting much attention and having fun at the same time. To use the basis of NFTs for this, it was obvious to us to collect donations and to combine the fun of NFTs and digital collectible figures. These digital collectible figures bring together: Donations that reduce the fight against growing CO2 emissions, have fun with donating for a good case, fun collecting with a new kind of figures, trendy voxel art style, cleverly staged figures from all known genres and a minimalist design, which turns the contents of any box into a new experience.

At the center of Voxel Collectible Figures are the VCF robots and friends. The Voxel Collectible Figures are heroes who fight together against the world problem CO2. Together with diverse hero characters and items the VCFs robots try to reduce CO2 emissions!

## Getting Started

Because of craco and cra5 we need to run --force during the installation process. I hope to remove this force option soon.

```zsh
npm i --force
npm start
